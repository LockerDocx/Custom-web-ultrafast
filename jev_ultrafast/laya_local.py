"""Laya: the open System-1 decision engine (ConvAI Innovations, Apache 2.0).

Laya is the open alternative to TypeSafe's Jev: instead of generating text it
answers typed questions (choice / score / boolean) in one forward pass, with
calibrated confidence, fully local — 322M-421M params, ~33 ms on GPU and a few
tens of ms on CPU. `pip install -e ".[laya]"` adds it; see
docs/laya.md for the full evaluation.

Used here for two decisions where a generative model is overkill and keywords
are brittle across languages:
- routing a mission: drive the live tab (browser) vs run the tool orchestrator
- picking the skill packages that should guide a mission

Everything is optional and fail-safe: if the package is missing, the weights
cannot load, or the calibrated confidence is below the gate, we fall back to
the keyword implementation without touching the run.
