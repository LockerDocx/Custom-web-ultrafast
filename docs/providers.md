# Model providers

Three independent model roles drive the agent, and each one can use a different provider at the same time:

- **Planner** — decomposes the mission into a short checklist of browser steps (optional). `PLANNER_*` variables.
- **Policy** — the fast executor: decides the operation and target on every step. TypeSafe Jev (the original) or any provider below. `POLICY_*` variables.
- **Text helper** — writes the value whenever the policy chooses `TYPE_TEXT`. `TEXT_MODEL_*` variables.

If `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set, the policy uses Jev and `POLICY_*` is ignored. Otherwise the policy resolves from `POLICY_PROVIDER` / `POLICY_API_KEY` / `POLICY_BASE_URL` / `POLICY_MODEL`. The text helper always resolves from `TEXT_MODEL_*` variables (its legacy `TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL` + `TEXT_MODEL` + `TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY` form keeps working).

## Recommended split: fast executor + deep planner

A slow, reasoning-heavy model plans once per task; a fast model executes every step. Two providers at once:

```bash
# Fast executor · GPT-OSS-20B on Groq (free tier, very low latency)
POLICY_PROVIDER=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
POLICY_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b
POLICY_REASONING=low

# Planner · GLM-5.3 on NVIDIA NIM (free endpoint)
PLANNER_PROVIDER=nvidia
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...
PLANNER_MODEL=z-ai/glm-5.3

# Text helper on Groq too: measured ~300 ms per field vs ~22 s with
# z-ai/glm-5.3-flash (which reasons by default).
TEXT_MODEL_PROVIDER=groq
TEXT_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b
TEXT_MODEL_REASONING=low
```

Without `PLANNER_*` configuration the agent keeps the original single-goal loop, so nothing changes for existing setups.

### How planning works

1. The planner is called **once** at task start with the mission and the initial page; it returns `{"steps": [...]}` (1–12 concrete steps).
2. The executor receives the mission, the full checklist (completed steps marked ✓), and the current step — and advances one step per turn.
3. A `DONE` choice marks the current step complete and continues with the next; the last `DONE` ends the run.
4. `BLOCKED` or three consecutive no-change actions trigger a bounded **replan** (max 2 per run): the planner sees the completed steps, the failure reason, and the current page, and returns only the remaining work.
5. The plan is guidance text only — the executor still validates every choice against the observed action space, so no step can invent elements or selectors.

## Presets

| `POLICY_PROVIDER` | Endpoint | Key variable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openai` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | JSON mode on |
| `anthropic` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Native Messages API (`x-api-key` + `anthropic-version`) |
| `openrouter` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Any catalog model, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` |
| `nvidia` (alias `nim`) | `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | NVIDIA NIM hosted inference |
| `omniroute` | `http://localhost:20128/v1` | `OMNIROUTE_API_KEY` | Self-hosted OmniRoute gateway; override the base URL for remote deployments |
| `deepseek` | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | Default for the text helper when nothing else is configured |
| `groq` | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `openai/gpt-oss-20b` is a fast free executor; `reasoning_effort` is mapped automatically |
| `together` | `https://api.together.xyz/v1` | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | |
| `mistral` | `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | |
| `xai` (alias `grok`) | `https://api.x.ai/v1` | `XAI_API_KEY` | |
| `gemini` (alias `google`) | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `custom` | yours, via `POLICY_BASE_URL` | `POLICY_API_KEY` | vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama, LiteLLM, any OpenAI-compatible gateway |
| *(a full URL)* | e.g. `POLICY_PROVIDER=https://gw.internal/v1` | `POLICY_API_KEY` | Same as `custom` |

Aliases: `nim`/`nvidia-nim` → `nvidia`, `grok` → `xai`, `google` → `gemini`, `omni` → `omniroute`, `openai-compatible` → `custom`.

The same table applies to the text helper with `TEXT_MODEL_PROVIDER` and `TEXT_MODEL_*`. When a `*_PROVIDER` is not given, the provider and dialect are inferred from the base URL (`https://api.anthropic.com` selects the Anthropic dialect; anything else is treated as OpenAI-compatible).

## Copy-paste examples

**OpenRouter**

```bash
POLICY_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
POLICY_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
# Optional separate text helper:
TEXT_MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter
TEXT_MODEL=inception/mercury-2.5
TEXT_MODEL_REASONING=none
```

**NVIDIA NIM**

```bash
POLICY_PROVIDER=nvidia
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...
POLICY_MODEL=meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct
```

**OmniRoute** (self-hosted gateway, default port 20128)

```bash
POLICY_PROVIDER=omniroute
POLICY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20128/v1   # only if not on the default port/host
OMNIROUTE_API_KEY=sk_omniroute
POLICY_MODEL=cc/claude-sonnet-4.5
```

**OpenAI**

```bash
POLICY_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
POLICY_MODEL=gpt-4.1
```

**Anthropic**

```bash
POLICY_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
POLICY_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5
```

**Your own gateway** (vLLM, LiteLLM, LM Studio, …)

```bash
POLICY_PROVIDER=custom
POLICY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
POLICY_API_KEY=dummy
POLICY_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
```

`POLICY_API_KEY` (or `TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY`) always wins over the preset's own key variable.

## How the generic policy works

The provider policy preserves the loop's core contract: **one request per decision cycle** and **only observed actions can execute**.

1. The same indexed element table, page excerpt, recent actions, and operation catalog that Jev receives are rendered into a single prompt (`POLICY_SYSTEM` in `questions.py`).
2. The model must reply with one JSON object: `{"operation": "CLICK", "target": "3", "confidence": 0.9}`. `SELECT` on a native dropdown uses an observed option index like `"5:2"`.
3. The reply is validated against the action space: an unknown operation, a target from another operation's head, or an invented index is rejected (after one corrective retry) and nothing executes. Model output never becomes selectors, coordinates, or code.
4. Unlike Jev, a generic LLM returns a choice, not a distribution — the inspector shows the chosen target and confidence instead of ranked probabilities.

## Reasoning and JSON mode

- `POLICY_REASONING` / `TEXT_MODEL_REASONING`: `none` (default), `low`, `medium`, `high`.
  - `none` disables thinking where the provider supports it (DeepSeek `thinking: disabled`, OpenRouter `reasoning: {enabled: false}`).
  - Effort levels map to `reasoning_effort` (OpenAI) and `reasoning.effort` (OpenRouter). Unverified combinations are omitted rather than sent.
- `POLICY_JSON_MODE` / `TEXT_MODEL_JSON_MODE`: `on`/`off` override. JSON mode (OpenAI `response_format`) is enabled only for presets that honor it across their catalog; everywhere else the reply is parsed robustly (fences and prose tolerated). Set it to `off` if your endpoint rejects the parameter.

## Local runtimes (free, offline, no API key)

Four local OpenAI-compatible runtimes are first-class presets, so no base URL and no key are needed:

| `POLICY_PROVIDER=` | Server | Default port |
|---|---|---|
| `ollama` | [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | 127.0.0.1:11434 |
| `lmstudio` | [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) | 127.0.0.1:1234 |
| `llamacpp` | [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) `llama-server` | 127.0.0.1:8080 |
| `jan` | [Jan](https://jan.ai) | 127.0.0.1:1337 |

A raw URL is auto-detected too (`POLICY_PROVIDER=http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` → `lmstudio`). JSON mode is off by default for local runtimes (server support varies; the reply parser already tolerates prose and fences), reasoning params are never sent to them, and the sidebar catalogue lists the models the running server exposes. Model recommendations by hardware tier (sub-32 GB RAM, CPU/iGPU/VRAM): [modelos-locales.md](modelos-locales.md).

## Laya — the open System-1 decision engine (optional, local)

[Laya](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) (Convai Innovations, Apache 2.0) is the open alternative to TypeSafe's Jev: it answers typed questions with calibrated confidence in one forward pass, fully local. This agent uses it — when installed — for two decisions where a generative model is overkill and keywords only know Spanish/English:

- **Mission routing** (browser loop vs tool orchestrator) in any language
- **Skill picking** (which procedural package guides the mission)

Everything is fail-safe: if the package is missing, the weights cannot load, or the calibrated confidence is below 0.55, the keyword implementation decides exactly as before. It is deliberately **not** used as the browser executor yet — its zero-shot choice accuracy and 512/1024-token context are not ready for picking among dozens of page elements (see docs/modelos-locales.md §2 for the numbers and the fine-tuning path).

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `JEV_LAYA=off` | disable Laya participation (keywords only) |
| `LAYA_CHECKPOINT` | `multilingual` (default, 322M, 100+ languages), `english` (421M), or `typed-decisions` |

Install: `pip install -e ".[laya]"` (or double-click `install-laya.bat` / `.command` / `.sh`). The «Laya check» CI workflow replays a multilingual battery with the real weights and reports the accuracy on the PR.

## The sidebar catalogue and parameters (MVP-1)

The Firefox sidebar's **⚙️ Models & parameters** panel replaces `.env` editing for everyday changes:

- **Catalogue**: `GET {base_url}/models` is fetched for every provider that has a key, filtered to chat models (embed/rerank/image/audio families excluded), and cached for 24 h in `artifacts/model-registry.json` (`JEV_MODEL_REGISTRY` moves it). `Refresh catalogue` forces a refetch. A rejected key (401/403) shows a message pointing at the provider's key page.
- **Pickers**: one per role; choosing a model updates the environment and the config file, then re-runs the setup self-test so a bad id is caught immediately. The executor picker also offers the built-in **TypeSafe Jev** policy when `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set; picking it back restores the built-in policy without a restart.
- **Presets**: *Fast / Balanced / Deep / Browser / Coding* — bundles of per-role parameters.
- **Advanced**: per-role reasoning effort and temperature.

Persistence: `artifacts/model-config.json` (`JEV_MODEL_CONFIG` moves it). At startup the saved selection is re-applied over `.env`, so the sidebar always wins once you have used it. Delete the file to fall back to `.env` only.

Related environment variables (all optional):

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PLANNER_TEMPERATURE`, `POLICY_TEMPERATURE`, `TEXT_MODEL_TEMPERATURE` | per-role temperature, 0–2, sent only when set |
| `JEV_MODEL_CONFIG` | where the sidebar's model/parameter choices persist |
| `JEV_MODEL_REGISTRY` | where the model catalogue cache persists |
| `JEV_SKILLS_DIR` | override the `skills/` directory (default: next to the package) |
| `JEV_RUNS_LOG` | where the per-run history is appended (default `artifacts/runs.jsonl`) |

**Profiles.** The panel can also save the *current* models + parameters as a named profile
(`Save` button) and re-apply it later with one click — handy for switching between a
"research" setup (deep planner) and a "local" setup (offline executor).

**Streaming.** Orchestrated tasks stream the model's raw output to the sidebar live
(the dashed "thinking" box between steps), including reasoning tokens when the model
emits them; endpoints that reject streaming fall back to a single request automatically.

**Run history.** Every finished task (browser or orchestrated) appends one line to
`artifacts/runs.jsonl` (timestamp, mode, goal, status, steps, elapsed, tokens) — plain
JSONL, easy to inspect or reset by deleting the file.

## Troubleshooting

- **`POLICY_API_KEY is not set or one of OPENROUTER_API_KEY...`** — provide the key in either form.
- **`POLICY_MODEL is not set`** — the policy role has no default model; name the exact id your provider expects.
- **HTTP 400 on `response_format`** — set `POLICY_JSON_MODE=off` (or the `TEXT_MODEL_JSON_MODE` equivalent).
- **HTTP 401/403** — the key does not match the provider/base URL combination.
- **OmniRoute 404s** — make sure the base URL includes `/v1` and the OmniRoute gateway is running.
- The text helper still refuses to guess: without a key, `TYPE_TEXT` stops with an error instead of typing an invented value.
