# Changelog

Notable changes per version. Versions 0.5.0 to 0.8.0 shipped inside the code line and are listed here even
though they never had a GitHub release; everything else has a tag.

**On the name:** until v0.11.0 the project and the add-on were called *Jev Ultrafast* — borrowed from
**TypeSafe AI**'s Jev model, because the upstream project this fork started from demonstrates it. It is not
ours, and it is gone from anything a user sees: the name is now *AI Agent for Firefox*. Internal
identifiers (`jev_ultrafast`, the `jev-*` console scripts, the `JEV_*` variables, the extension id and the
native-messaging host name) were kept on purpose, so installations and Firefox registrations that already
exist keep working.

**On the measurements:** the performance figures in `docs/` were recorded by the upstream project, on
Chrome, with TypeSafe's hosted policy and the Mercury text model. They are labelled as such wherever they
appear. This build drives Firefox with Groq/NVIDIA and has not been measured yet.


## [0.12.1] — 2026-09-25

### Added

- **The planner asks twice when its first reply is unusable.** Measured: one planner call in ten came
  back **empty** from NVIDIA's GLM endpoint, at the same rate with 1024 and with 2048 tokens (so it is
  not a truncated answer, and a bigger budget does not fix it). The planner runs once per mission, so a
  second question is cheap and keeps the checklist; a connection failure is not asked again, because the
  HTTP layer already spends its three attempts on the wire.
- **A CI job that proves the one-key promise.** `.github/workflows/single-key-check.yml` runs the self-test twice —
  NVIDIA key only, Groq key only — with every role and model override removed, so the derivation has to configure
  all three roles on its own; a role that cannot run fails the job, and a role that is merely rate-limited is
  reported as capacity. `scripts/single_key_check.sh` is the script behind it, runnable locally too.
- **A bench that measures candidate model profiles instead of guessing.** `scripts/bench_profiles.py`
  (`.github/workflows/model-profiles.yml`, one job per candidate) reports median and worst latency per role
  from the prompts and token budgets the agent itself uses, plus three objective quality checks: a valid plan,
  the routing decision on the project's own 241-mission battery, and the exact value the goal supplied for a
  field. It was written to answer one question — *"what if we limit the AI: glm-5.3 flash without reasoning?"* —
  and the answer stops the guesswork: flash with thinking off was the **slowest** NVIDIA candidate measured
  (85 s / 43 s / 42 s medians for planner, executor and text against 30 s / 36 s / 9 s for the shipped
  defaults), because what costs time on that free tier is the queue, not the parameters. `docs/providers.md`
  carries the table.

### Fixed

- **"Model connection failed" no longer means "your key is wrong", and it stops happening so often.** A user whose
  single NVIDIA NIM key was working saw the planner and the executor red with that sentence while the text role, on
  the same key, answered after 37.8 s — three 25 s attempts had gone by without one byte, which is a free endpoint
  waking up. The wait is now 60 s per attempt (`JEV_HTTP_TIMEOUT` overrides it), the retries stay, and the message
  says which failure it was: nothing answered in time — *"the endpoint is slow or busy, not a rejected key"* — or
  the connection could not be established (network, proxy, VPN). A key the provider really rejects is still answered
  with its own HTTP 401 and named as a key problem.
- **The panel no longer calls a configured model "missing".** With a model that had not answered, the verdict read
  *"Not ready: Planner, Executor have no model"* — with `Planner · nvidia:z-ai/glm-5.3` printed right above it. That
  sentence sends you looking for a key you have already pasted. "No model" is now reserved for a role that has
  none; a role that has one and stayed silent says *"did not answer — the model is configured, the endpoint is slow
  or unreachable. Press Test setup to try again."*
- **A self-test is no longer a frozen panel.** The wait is shown while it happens: the box reads *"Testing every
  model connection… 12 s"* with the seconds ticking, the button is disabled so a second press is not dropped
  silently, and every role is announced as it starts and finishes (`Testing Executor (nvidia:openai/gpt-oss-20b)…`,
  *answered in 1 282 ms*, or *FAILED — no answer within 60 s*). The roles are asked one after another, which is the
  honest reason a slow free tier takes minutes.
- **`check_providers` takes an optional `on_event` callback**, so any caller (the host today, a script tomorrow) can
  report progress; a caller that passes nothing gets exactly the report it always got.
- **The live-provider check no longer goes red when an endpoint simply stalls.** The run of 25 Sep was red on
  NVIDIA NIM leaving `openai/gpt-oss-20b` unanswered for 76 s, while the same provider answered for
  `z-ai/glm-5.3` in the same run and re-running it unchanged went green. A probe that comes back with no verdict
  at all is now asked again — up to three attempts, and the number of attempts is printed — while a real verdict
  (parameters verified or refused) is reported as it came, first time. The parameter check stays a hard one.
- **A panel test that could fail on a slow machine is now decided by handshakes.** The test for a verdict
  arriving from before the key slept 0.4 s hoping the key would be saved inside that window; on the Windows
  runner it was not, so the check already in flight answered first and the test read that as a stale verdict
  being published. The key save and the check's answer are now ordered with events, and the test additionally
  asserts the discarded verdict was never broadcast to the sidebar at all.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-09-25

You can now see what the agent is doing instead of guessing.

### Added

- **A verdict before you run.** The sidebar answers "can it run?" in one line: green with the model each role will
  use, or red naming the roles that have no model and how to fix it. It used to be three red dots and a paragraph to
  interpret.
- **A progress bar that does not invent numbers.** It is a real percentage when the host measured one (the plan
  position in browser mode: *step 2 of 3*); otherwise it moves while the agent works and the meta line reports what is
  actually known — step count, the cap (`step_budget`, 25), elapsed time, tokens.
- **A conversation view.** What you asked, what the agent said it would do, each tool call with the result it returned,
  the answer and the closing line, in the order it happened. The model's streaming output grows in place instead of
  appearing and vanishing whenever a step arrived.
- **A log view.** Every event with its timestamp and level (`SYSTEM` / `TOOL` / `OK` / `WARN` / `ERROR`), one line
  each, including the failures that used to leave no trace.
- **A headless harness for the panel.** `tests/sidebar_harness.mjs` runs `sidebar.js` against a stub DOM and
  `tests/test_sidebar_activity.py` asserts on what a user would see: the order of the conversation, the indeterminate
  bar when there is no total, a determinate one when there is, the log contents, the verdict. The panel's behaviour is
  tested now instead of assumed (it skips where Node is missing).

### Fixed

- **A saved key can no longer hide in another file.** The key file was resolved relative to the process working
  directory, and Firefox chooses that directory when it launches the native host: a key pasted in the sidebar (or
  typed into the checkout's `.env`) was invisible the next time the agent started from elsewhere, which showed up as
  *"nothing is configured"* with a key already saved. Reads and writes now resolve one file per installation — the
  checkout's `.env`, `JEV_ENV_FILE` to move it, `~/.config/jev-ultrafast/.env` for a package install — and the panel
  and the startup line both name that exact path, so the answer to "where did my key go?" is on screen.

### Changed

- **A role is named the same everywhere.** The messages said "the policy role" while the panel said "Executor", which
  read like two different problems; both now use the panel's names (Planner, Executor, Text writer).
- The host publishes `step_budget` in its state so the panel can say "at most 25 steps" without hardcoding it.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-25

The version that took the project from "assumed macOS" to the systems people actually run, and that proves
it instead of claiming it.

### Added

- CI that runs the real thing: openSUSE **Leap 15.6** and **Tumbleweed** containers (zypper, the starter,
  install, full suite), a **Windows** job (native messaging over stdio, registry, key handling, starter)
  and Python **3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13** — plus the whole suite again under a non-UTF-8 locale.
- Platform tests that drive the actual starters against fake per-distro interpreters, and per-distro Python
  install hints inside the starter itself.
- Windows interpreter discovery through the `py` launcher, with a warning when `python` is the Microsoft
  Store stub.

### Changed

- `requires-python` lowered to **3.11** (what current distributions still ship as an option), and the
  starter looks for `python3.13` → `python3.12` → `python3.11` → `python3` instead of assuming the first
  `python3` it finds is new enough.
- The user-facing name is **AI Agent for Firefox**; release assets are named `ai-agent-for-firefox-*`;
  the repository is `firefox-ai-agent`.
- README rewritten to describe this project rather than the upstream one it started from.

### Fixed

- Every text file the agent reads or writes declares UTF-8. Without it, a Windows machine under a legacy
  code page could not even start the agent (`snapshot.js` contains non-ASCII characters).
- `.env` is read as `utf-8-sig`, so a key saved by Notepad with a BOM is no longer invisible to the agent.
- SUSE package names in the docs and in CI (`python312`, never `python3.12`).
- A connection-level failure now retries on the plain request path exactly as the streaming path already
  did — a model being woken up no longer kills a run on the first attempt.
- `[project.urls]` no longer swallows the `dependencies` line, which broke every fresh install.


## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-25 — Firefox starts the agent itself

The double-click became optional: Firefox launches the local host through native messaging, so opening the sidebar *is* starting the agent.

### Added

- Native messaging: a per-user manifest registered once (`jev-register-host`, with `--status` and `--unregister`), on Linux, macOS and Windows (registry, no admin rights).
- The host accepts only this add-on (`allowed_extensions`), and it stops when Firefox closes — nothing keeps running in the background.

### Changed

- The double-click starter stays as the documented fallback, and as the route on snap/Flatpak Firefox.

### Fixed

- Registration that a browser can actually launch, after CI proved the first version could not.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-25 — The setup happens in Firefox

Setup stopped being a terminal task: the sidebar asks for one key, checks it and configures everything, which is what makes a no-console install real.

Between v0.4.0 and this release, versions 0.5.0 to 0.8.0 shipped inside the code line without a GitHub release: the parameter surface became the model's, the isolated Neko browser, permission centre and audit log landed, local LLM runtimes were dropped on purpose, and one free key started configuring all three roles.

### Added

- Graphical setup in the sidebar: paste one free API key, it is validated against the provider, written to `.env` and applied immediately — no restart, no file editing.
- The panel reports what the key bought (`planner … · policy … · text …`) and reopens the card with the provider's exact error when a key is rejected.
- CI guard that fails if the double-click starters lose their executable bit.

### Fixed

- The executable bit itself, which the guard immediately caught.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-23 — Quality at scale: 241-mission battery, provider bench and a live E2E

The version that answered the question the previous ones left open: does any of this still hold at scale? It answered with real resources in CI, not with simulations.

### Added

- Routing battery: 241 labelled missions — 6 languages × 36 core missions plus 25 adversarial ones (mixed intent, multi-clause, bilingual, telegraphic, typos) — scoring raw Laya against the shipped stack and tracking *dangerous* confusion above all.
- Provider bench that probes live endpoints instead of trusting documentation.
- Live flights mission in CI: real providers, real browser, a token budget per provider and a report that survives even a failed run.

### Fixed

- Tool signals outrank a confident page answer; suggestions complete before the model is asked to choose; the demo's expired date no longer makes the mission impossible.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-23 — The whole fork merged: MVP-1 to MVP-6, Laya and the security pass

The first version containing all of the fork's work in one place (PR #1: 27 commits, about 9,100 lines).

### Added

- Model catalogue and provider layer (MVP-1/2): presets, key handling, per-role selection.
- Tools, skills and the orchestrator (MVP-3/4): web search, files, document parsing, terminal commands.
- Command approvals (MVP-4): side-effecting commands pause for an explicit yes, and a timeout means no.
- Streaming responses, saved profiles and run history (MVP-6).
- Laya integration with a measured confidence gate, published next to the vendor claims.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-22 — Pluggable providers, planner–executor loop, Firefox sidebar

First release of this fork: the reference browser loop, rebuilt around providers you choose and a Firefox sidebar that drives the tab you are looking at.

### Added

- Pluggable model providers (NVIDIA NIM, Groq, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Together, Mistral, xAI, Gemini, or your own gateway) with a planner–executor split.
- Firefox WebExtension sidebar and the local bridge it talks to over loopback.
- Double-click starters for Windows, macOS and Linux, plus a Spanish guide written for people who do not use a console (EMPEZAR-AQUI.md).
- CI with automatic release artifacts (source archive, `.xpi`, wheel).
- Laya, the open System One decision engine (Convai Innovations, Apache 2.0), as the optional local router.
- Production security pass: secret redaction, an action audit log, and CPU/memory/file limits on approved commands.

*The pattern is simple: a version ships when its own claims can be checked — by tests in the repository, or
by CI on the systems it says it supports.*
